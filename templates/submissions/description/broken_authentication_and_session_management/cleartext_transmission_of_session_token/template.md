# Cleartext Transmission of Session Token

## Overview

<!--
Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf for tips

This format is a good guide:
[VULNTYPE] in [COMPONENT] in [APPLICATION] allows [ATTACKER] to [IMPACT] via [VECTOR] 
-->

Cleartext transmission of the session token over an unencrypted channel at {{url}} allows a malicious attacker to intercept this session token via a Person in the Middle (PitM) attack

## Walkthrough & PoC

<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!
-->

1. Navigate to the {{application}} at {{url}}
1. View the HTTP headers using an HTTP proxy
1. Observe the secure flag is not set
1. Observe cookies are sent in cleartext

## Vulnerability Evidence

<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For a cleartext transmission vulnerability, please include a simple URL that can be executed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue. 
-->

Below is a screenshot displaying the HTTP header request for the page {{url}}.

## Demonstrated Impact

<!--
Attempt to perform additional actions using the provided session token (such as cookie-based XSS). If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept here.
--> 

A malicious attacker could abuse the session token further to {{action}} by using the following payload.

```
{{payload}}
```
