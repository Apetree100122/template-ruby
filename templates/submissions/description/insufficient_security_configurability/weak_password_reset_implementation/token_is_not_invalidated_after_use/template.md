# Weak Password Reset Implementation (Token is Not Invalidated After Use)
## Overview
<!--
Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf for tips

This format is a good guide:
[VULNTYPE] in [COMPONENT] in [APPLICATION] allows [ATTACKER] to [IMPACT] via [VECTOR]


-->
Password reset token is not invalidated after use in {{application}} of {{target}}, allowing a malicious attacker to {{action}}

## Walkthrough & PoC
<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Example:

1. Login to in-scope asset at <www.bugcrowd.com/login>
1. Browse to account page
1. Modify ID token to add single quote
1. View error which states 'SQL Syntax Error'
1. Replace ID value with `1' waitfor delay '00:00:10'; `
-->

1. Navigate to {{url}} and initiate a password reset
1. Utilize the password reset token received to reset the password
1. Observe that the password reset token received earlier is still valid after being used


## Vulnerability Evidence
<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For a reset password token that is not invalidated after use, please post a screenshot or video that shows that the token remains valid even after a new token is requested.

## Demonstrated Impact
<!--
Envision how a reset password token that is not invalidated after use could endanger the user account. If a malicious action is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept here.
-->

A password reset token that is not invalidated after use endangers the user. If a malicious attacker were to gain access to the whatever system is used to store the already-used reset token, they could use this valid token to reset the user's password.
