# Weak Password Reset Implementation (Token Has Long Timed Expiry)
## Overview
<!--
Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf for tips

This format is a good guide:
[VULNTYPE] in [COMPONENT] in [APPLICATION] allows [ATTACKER] to [IMPACT] via [VECTOR]


-->
Password reset token has long timed expiry in {{application}} of {{target}} allows a malicious attacker to {{action}}

## Walkthrough & PoC
<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Example:

1. Login to in-scope asset at <www.bugcrowd.com/login>
1. Browse to account page
1. Modify ID token to add single quote
1. View error which states 'SQL Syntax Error'
1. Replace ID value with `1' waitfor delay '00:00:10'; `
-->

1. Log in to {{application}}
1. Navigate to {{url}} and initiate a password reset
1. Observe in a HTTP proxy or over time that the password reset token has a long timed expiry


## Vulnerability Evidence
<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For a reset password token with a long timed expiry, please post a screenshot that shows that the token does not expire after a long time. Please specify the specific amount of time is required before the token expires. If the token never expires, please specify this below.

You can observe that the password reset token has a long timed expiry below:

## Demonstrated Impact
<!--
Envision how the long timed expiry of the password reset token could be used by a malicious attacker (such as the brute forcing of valid tokens). If a malicious action is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept here.
-->

A password reset token with a long timed expiry could allow a malicious attacker to gain access to an account. If the token does not expire for a long period of time, this simply allows the attacker more time to discover an unexpired reset password token and use it to take over its account.
