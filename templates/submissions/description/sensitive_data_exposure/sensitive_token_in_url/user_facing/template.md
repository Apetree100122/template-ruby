## Walkthrough & PoC

<!-- Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Example:

1. Browse to the URL <www.inscope.com/login>
1. Attempt to sign into the website using the login button
1. Observe the page running on HTTP as default

1. Run the following command on a machine with cURL installed
```bash
curl -I www.inscope.com/login
```
1. Observe the repsonse showing a 200 OK on the HTTP response

 -->

1. Navigate to the following endpoing Bugcrowd.com/password-reset-url

1. {{action}} and notice the exposed token in the URL

## Vulnerability Evidence

<!-- 
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

This can include a cURL response from the website showing that HTTP is default or HTTPS is not avalible.
 -->

The following image(s) show the full exploit:

## Demonstrated Impact
<!--
Demonstrating increased impact results in higher rewards! 

Credentials transmitted over HTTP are transmitted in Plaintext, allowing any attacker to intercept these requests, and obtain the login credentials for that user. 
-->

Sensitive data disclosure of sensitive tokens in the URL allows attackers to locally reset a password to one they control and takeover user accounts.
