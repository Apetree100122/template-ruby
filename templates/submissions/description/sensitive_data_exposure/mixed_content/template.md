## Walkthrough & PoC

<!-- Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Example:

1. Browse to the URL <www.inscope.com/login>
1. Attempt to sign into the website using the login button
1. Observe the page running on HTTP as default

1. Run the following command on a machine with cURL installed
```bash
curl -I www.inscope.com/login
```
1. Observe the repsonse showing a 200 OK on the HTTP response

 -->

1. Navigate to the following endpoing Bugcrowd.com/vulnerable-url

1. Use Developer Tools Network tab to see that sensitive content is being served over HTTP:

## Vulnerability Evidence

<!-- 
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

This can include a cURL response from the website showing that HTTP is default or HTTPS is not avalible.

## Demonstrated Impact
<!--
Demonstrating increased impact results in higher rewards! 

Credentials transmitted over HTTP are transmitted in Plaintext, allowing any attacker to intercept these requests, and obtain the login credentials for that user.

Sensitive data disclosure mixed content can enable malicious attackers to collect sensitive metadata to escalate privileges or launch phishing campaigns on targeted users.
