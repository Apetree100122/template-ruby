# Aggressive Offline Caching

## Overview
Browsers implement features such as service workers to offer offline features for an application such as caching, notifications, and offloading computation for applications such as Progressive Web Applications (PWA), occasionally, these offline workers can cause issues such as high CPU usage or overly aggressive offline caching.

HTTPS not Available or HTTP by default on Login Page Vulnerability Report

## Walkthrough & PoC

<!-- Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Example:

1. Browse to the URL <www.inscope.com/login>
1. Attempt to sign into the website using the login button
1. Observe the page running on HTTP as default

1. Run the following command on a machine with cURL installed
```bash
curl -I www.inscope.com/login
```
1. Observe the repsonse showing a 200 OK on the HTTP response

 -->

1. Navigate to the following URL: bugcrowd.com/vulnerable-endpoint

1. Use {{software}} to profile when service worker is active and compare to when the server worker is not active:

## Vulnerability Evidence

<!-- 
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

This can include a cURL response from the website showing that HTTP is default or HTTPS is not avalible.
 -->

The following image(s) show the full exploit:

## Demonstrated Impact
<!--
Demonstrating increased impact results in higher rewards! 

Credentials transmitted over HTTP are transmitted in Plaintext, allowing any attacker to intercept these requests, and obtain the login credentials for that user. 
-->

Depending on the implementation of the service worker, Aggressive Offline Caching can act as a vector for Denial of Service (DoS) by consuming compute to overly write to offline cache.
