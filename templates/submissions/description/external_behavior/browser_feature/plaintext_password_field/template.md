## Walkthrough & PoC

<!-- Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Example:

1. Browse to the URL <www.inscope.com/login>
1. Attempt to sign into the website using the login button
1. Observe the page running on HTTP as default

1. Run the following command on a machine with cURL installed
```bash
curl -I www.inscope.com/login
```
1. Observe the repsonse showing a 200 OK on the HTTP response

 -->

1. Navigate to the following URL: bugcrowd.com/vulnerable-endpoint

1. Enter text within the input field 

1. Use the Inspect tool to see that the input is shown in plaintext

## Vulnerability Evidence

<!-- 
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

This can include a cURL response from the website showing that HTTP is default or HTTPS is not avalible.

## Demonstrated Impact
<!--
Demonstrating increased impact results in higher rewards! 

Credentials transmitted over HTTP are transmitted in Plaintext, allowing any attacker to intercept these requests, and obtain the login credentials for that user. 
-->

An attacker with local access can login as a user or leverage critical pieces of information to impersonate the user or make requests on their behalf.
