Content spoofing is a common attack where malicious attackers can insert plaintext or HTML that can be rendered on a client to social engineer users to do something.

Content spoofing in {{target}} allows a malicious attacker to {{action}}

## Walkthrough & PoC
<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Example:

1. Browse to the URL <https://111.111.111.111>
1. Click through the certificate error
1. You will see from the HTTP title that this the IP Address for <https://secure.inscope.com> 
-->

1. Navigate to endpoint: {{value}}

1. {{action}} to send an email request

1. Change {{parameter}} to {{value}} and forward or replay request in {{software}}

1. Check email to see rendered HTML

## Vulnerability Evidence
<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

This can be using a screenshot of both pages side by side with the address bar in the screenshot, or if the domain is not protecting its IP Address, a DIG showing the record for the domain and IP Address.

## Demonstrated Impact
<!--
A WAF Bypass allows an attacker to bypass existing Web Application Firewall protections, leaving the web service open to attacks against the web service.
--> 

A successful HTML content spoof on emails can allow a malicious attacker to social engineer users to navigate to another website and have them enter something like their user credentials.
