# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For a Remote Code Execution vulnerability, you may execute some commands to prove that the code execution works, but do not access or attempt to access sensitive information. Do not access Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Do not pivot or access internal systems which are deemed out of scope.

If you need to upload a file to demonstrate the vulnerability, where possible, please give the file a randomly generated name that is not possible to guess. In addition, it is not permitted to perform interactive execution of commands remotely. Your PoC must only demonstrate that a non-sensitive command can be executed when the page is accessed. Do not upload interactive web shells.

An example of some commands that can show access to the server are; `cat /etc/hostname`, `cat /etc/passwd`, `cat /etc/issues`, and `ifconfig`.
