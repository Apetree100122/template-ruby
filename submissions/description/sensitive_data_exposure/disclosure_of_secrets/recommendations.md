# Recommendation(s)

There are a number of best practices involved with implementing authentication methods and session management. Declare the type of access allowed for each resource and deny access by default, unless these specific access conditions are met by a user attempting to access the resource. To enforce these access controls, itâ€™s important to use a single application wide mechanism.

It is recommended that all critical information is stored server-side, with only a session ID being passed back and forth between the server and client. Similarly, the data being sent to the client should be encrypted to ensure that data cannot be viewed in transit, and it should be digitally signed to ensure the data's integrity.

Thoroughly test and audit the access controls during the development and deployment lifecycle to ensure the security and integrity of the controls.
