# Guidance

Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see [CVE Project's Key Details Phrasing Guide](http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf) for tips. Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

For authentication bypass vulnerabilities, include instructions on how to access the vulnerable authentication mechanism and steps to bypass it in order to perform a function or access data not intended for that user. Provide screenshots to show the functionality accessed without valid authentication.

Explain why this bypass is a risk and how it can be used as an attack vector. If safe, perform a function that is shown to require authentication.
