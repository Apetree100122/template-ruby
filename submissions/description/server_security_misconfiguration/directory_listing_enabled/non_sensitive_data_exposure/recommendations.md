The server should be configured to not enable directory listings by default. Additionally, important directories and files should have strong authorization requirements.

It is recommended that all servers are managed through a automated and repeatable configuration process which covers server hardening, updates, security headers, and segmentation. There should also be an auto automated verification process which tests the effectiveness of the configurations and settings.
