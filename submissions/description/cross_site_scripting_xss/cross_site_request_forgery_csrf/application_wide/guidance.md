# Guidance

Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see <http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf> for tips.
Also provide a step-by-step walkthrough with screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For an application-wide CSRF vulnerability, please include the proof of concept CSRF HTML code for at least four sensitive CSRF actions.

Attempt to escalate the lack of CSRF protection to perform an account takeover or some other sensitive action. If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept.
